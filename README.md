GMLoader is a program that can load CSharp Script files and recompile non-YYC GM:Studio games. It will make a backup of your data files to ensure that you'll never corrupt your game data while recompiling. The builtin scripts currently allow you to add/replace GML/ASM/Room assets

You will need to run the program once everytime you install/remove a mod that requires GMLoader. This will save your time in recompiling the game's data.
